# Marks Management System - Mini Project

A simple **Python-based Marks Management System** that allows you to manage student records, calculate grades, and update marks.  
This project is designed as a mini-project for learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python.

##  Features
-  **Add Student** – Store roll number, name, and subject-wise marks.
-  **Display All Students** – View all student records with total, average, and grade.
-  **Search Student** – Find a student by roll number.
-  **Update Marks** – Modify marks for a specific subject.
-  **Grade Calculation** – Automatically assigns grades based on average marks:
  - `A+` → avg ≥ 90  
  - `A`  → avg ≥ 75  
  - `B`  → avg ≥ 60  
  - `C`  → avg ≥ 40  
  - `F`  → avg < 40
